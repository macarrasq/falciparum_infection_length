# Infection length determination of Plasmodium falciparum clones from amplicon sequencing data
This file presents an R Markdown analysis for determining the duration of Plasmodium falciparum infection based on amplicon sequencing data of a highly polymorphic gene (apical-membrane protein 1 or ama1). The analysis involves processing the data obtained from amplicon sequencing and implements different numbers of skips (e.g. how many timepoints are allowed of an ama1 clone to be absent to still consider it a longitudinal infection rather than a reinfection).
