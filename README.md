# Infection length of Plasmodium falciparum clones from amplicon sequencing data of a highly polymorphic antigen (Ama1)
Infection length using amplicon sequencing longitudinal data 
We have determined the longth of individual P. falciparum clones within individuals over time. The type of data was obtained through longitudinal sampling of children throughout one transmission season
